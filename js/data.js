This was a Multi-tiered, MVC Client-Server application. The Client was built using Java Swing.\n\nIn my earlier years at Serena, I created various tools and utilities, including a  specialized JDBC Driver  that translated on-the-fly SQL queries written initially for SQLSERVER to Oracle and DB2 SQL syntax, a Java Swing WYSIWYG IDE for creating custom forms for the company’s early ALM tool, a Swing Document Diff / Merge Application, and an SWT Eclipse Plug-in."

We had a few boxed, consumer products like 3D Home Interior which was sold under an OEM to Broderbund Software.\n\nFor my fist project at ModaCAD, I created a CAD application called ModaWeave which simulated the design of Woven fabrics. This was a professional design software utilized d by fashion designers at companies like Lands End, the Gap, Levis, Janzen etc. to prototype woven fabrics, and using our other applications, create realistic 3D renderings.\n \nThis application was developed with Java 1.1, with it’s very primitives Graphics AWT library. It was natively compiled for Windows using an IDE called SuperCede. To the best of my knowledge, this may have been the first ever CAD application that was written exclusively in Java. \n\nNext at ModaCAD, I was the technical lead of a project, and web site called StyleClick.com. This was a fashion portal and E-Commerce site that used Java Servlets, JDBC and Weblogic Application Server.\n\nOne of the final projects I worked on at ModaCAD was a Fuzzy Logic based image comparison engine used for Fabric sample Matching. The same engine was later used to build a Fashion Recommendation Engine, and was one of the reasons \n\nIn 1998, riding the .com wave, ModaCAD renamed itself as StyleClick.com, and sold off its core CAD business. At the time I was tasked with creating a data syndication engine, and with XML becoming popular at the time, designed a set of XML over HTTP Web services. This was before the term was officially coined, and the SOAP protocol was conceived.\n\nIn 1999 ModaCAD was bought by USA Networks, and has since dissolved."
